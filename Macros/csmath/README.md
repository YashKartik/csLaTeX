## Package Overview

The `csmath` package offers a comprehensive set of custom LaTeX commands designed specifically for computer scientists. It covers a wide range of mathematical expressions, number theory, probability and statistics, logic, document structure, theoretical computer science articles, cryptographic notation, and various functions commonly used in the field. The package aims to enhance the readability and expressiveness of computer science documents by providing intuitive and consistent commands for frequently used symbols and notations.

## Usage

To use the `csmath` package, simply include the following line in the preamble of your LaTeX document:

```latex
\usepackage{csmath}
```

This will import the package and make its features available for use throughout your document.

## Math Commands

The `csmath` package provides several custom commands for mathematical expressions:

- `\mathify{#1}`: Ensures that the argument is in math mode.
- `\dd`: Represents the differential operator �d�.
- `\bigO`: Represents the Big O notation for asymptotic analysis.
- `\set{#1}`: Represents a set with the given elements.
- `\floor{#1}`: Represents the floor function.
- `\ceil{#1}`: Represents the ceiling function.  
These commands enhance the typesetting of mathematical expressions and provide a consistent formatting style across the document.

## Number Theory Commands

The package includes commands related to number theory:

- `\gcd`: Represents the greatest common divisor.
- `\lcm`: Represents the least common multiple.
- `\lcmset{#1}`: Represents the least common multiple of a set of numbers.
- `\jacobi{#1}{#2}`: Represents the Jacobi symbol.
- `\legendre{#1}{#2}`: Represents the Legendre symbol.  
These commands simplify the notation for number theoretic concepts and operations.

## Set Notation Commands

The package provides commands for common set notation:

- `\N`, `\Z`, `\Q`, `\R`, `\C`: Sets of natural, integer, rational, real, and complex numbers.
- `\Zplus`, `\Znonneg`, `\Rplus`, `\Rnonneg`, `\Qplus`, `\Qnonneg`: Sets of positive and non-negative numbers.  
These commands facilitate the representation of sets in various contexts.

## Probability and Statistics Commands

The package includes commands for probability and statistics:

- `\Prob{#1}`: Represents the probability of an event.
- `\Exp{#1}`: Represents the expectation of a random variable. 
- `\half`: Represents half as a fraction. 
These commands simplify the notation for probability and statistical calculations.

## Logic Commands

The package provides commands for logic:

- `\true`, `\false`: Represent true and false values.
- `\var{#1}`: Represents a variable.  
These commands aid in expressing logical statements and formulas.

## Document Structure Commands

The package includes commands for document structure and formatting:

- `\figcaption{#1}`: Formats a figure caption.
- `\tabcaption{#1}`: Formats a table caption.
- `\head{#1}`: Formats a lecture heading.  
These commands improve the organization and presentation of the document.

## Theoretical Computer Science Commands

The package offers commands for theoretical computer science mainly computational complexity:

- Complexity classes: `\Pclass`, `\NPclass`, `\coNPclass`, `\BPPclass`, `\RPclass`, `\coRPclass`, `\ZPPclass`, `\IPclass`, `\PHclass`, `\PSPACEclass`, `\EXPclass`, `\NEXPclass`.
- Notations for polynomial hierarchy: `\SigmaP{#1}`, `\PiP{#1}`, `\DeltaP{#1}`.  
These commands simplify the representation of complexity classes and hierarchy levels.

## Cryptographic Notation Commands

The package provides commands for cryptographic notation:

- Cryptographic primitives: `\cipher`, `\hash`, `\mac`, `\prf`, `\prp`, `\prg`, `\sig`, `\vrfy`, `\enc`, `\dec`, `\keygen`, `\keyexchange`.
- Notations for cryptographic protocols: `\protocol`, `\attack`, `\advantage`, `\securityparam`.
- Security notions: `\indcpa`, `\indcca`, `\authint`, `\nmac`, `\sufcma`, `\ufcma`, `\eav`, `\cca`, `\cpa`.  
These commands aid in expressing cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and security properties.

## Function Commands

The package includes commands for various functions:

- Negligible functions: `\negl`.
- Noticeable functions: `\notice`.
- Polynomial functions: `\poly`.  
These commands provide shorthand notations for common functions used in computational complexity analysis.
