# Theorem Environments for Computer Science (`csthm.sty`)

This LaTeX package provides a set of theorem-like environments tailored for use in computer science documents. It includes theorem, lemma, corollary, proposition, definition, remark, claim, fact, assumption, conjecture, problem, solution, and case environments, along with custom lists and proof environments.

## Package Overview

The `csthm` package provides a collection of theorem-like environments suitable for writing papers, reports, or theses in the field of computer science. These environments include commonly used structures such as theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and definitions, along with specialized environments like proofs, problems, solutions, and cases. The package is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to easily adapt it to their specific needs.

## Usage

To use the `csthm` package, simply include the following line in the preamble of your LaTeX document:

```latex
\usepackage{csthm}
```

This will import the package and make its features available for use throughout your document.

## Environments

The `csthm` package provides the following theorem-like environments:

- `theorem`
- `lemma`
- `corollary`
- `proposition`
- `definition`
- `remark`
- `claim`
- `fact`
- `assumption`
- `conjecture`
- `problem`
- `solution`
- `case`
- `example`  

These environments can be used to structure and organize your mathematical content effectively.

## Customization

The package allows users to customize the names of theorem-like environments by redefining the corresponding commands. For example, to change the name of the theorem environment to “Proposition”, use the following command:

```latex
\renewcommand{\theoremName}{Proposition}
```

Similarly, other environment names can be customized using the corresponding commands.

## Proof Environments

The `csthm` package also provides several proof environments for writing proofs and related content:

- `proof`: Standard-proof environment.
- `proofSketch`: Environment for sketching proofs.
- `proofIdea`: Environment for outlining proof ideas.
- `proofOfLemma`: Environment for proving a specific lemma.
- `proofAttempt`: Environment for documenting proof attempts.
- `proofOf{Environment}`: Environment for proving a specific theorem-like environment.  

These environments help maintain consistency and clarity in presenting proofs within the document.

## Case Environment

The case environment is provided for structuring case-based arguments or proofs. It allows for easy enumeration and referencing of cases within a larger argument or proof.

## Custom Lists

The package includes custom list environments tailored for use within the case environment. These lists facilitate the enumeration and formatting of cases, providing flexibility and readability.

## QED Symbol

The package defines a custom QED symbol, which is automatically appended to the end-of-proof environments. The default symbol is a filled black square (■), but users can customize it according to their preferences.

## Package Clash Check

The `csthm` package includes a check for package clashes with the `amsthm` package. If the `amsthm` package is already loaded, the package will issue a warning message to alert the user.

## Example

Below is an example of how to use the `csthm` package in a LaTeX document:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{csthm}

\begin{document}

\begin{theorem}[Name of theorem]
  This is a theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  This is a proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Name of definition]
 This is a definition.
\end{definition}

\end{document}
```
