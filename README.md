# csLaTeX

> Welcome to the `csLaTeX` repository! This repository hosts a curated collection of LaTeX macros tailored specifically for computer scientists. Whether you’re a researcher, student, or industry professional in the field of computer science, our repository is dedicated to providing you with LaTeX commands to optimize your document preparation workflow.

## Repository Contents

### `cscolorthm`

The `cscolorthm.sty` package provides a range of colourful theorem and proof environments for LaTeX documents. It uses the `tcolorbox` package to make theorem-like structures visually appealing while maintaining readability. Users can easily create custom theorem environments like theorem, lemma, corollary, etc., and various proof environments like standard proof, proof sketch, etc. This package aims to enhance the presentation of mathematical content.

### `csmath`

The `csmath.sty` package furnishes various custom LaTeX commands crafted for computer scientists. Encompassing a wide spectrum of mathematical expressions, number theory, probability and statistics, logic, document structuring, theoretical computer science articles, cryptographic notation, and assorted functions prevalent in the field, this package serves as a useful resource.

### `csthm`

The `csthm.sty` package offers a suite of theorem-like environments tailored specifically for incorporation into computer science documents. Featuring theorem, lemma, corollary, proposition, definition, remark, claim, fact, assumption, conjecture, problem, solution, and case environments, alongside bespoke lists and proof environments, these constructs are designed to facilitate the structured organization of mathematical content.

## How to Use

Leveraging these packages in your LaTeX documents is straightforward:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Transfer the desired package (`csmath.sty` or `csthm.sty` or `cscolorthm.sty`) into your LaTeX project directory.
3. In the preamble of your LaTeX document, import the package using `\usepackage{csmath}` or `\usepackage{thmcs}` or `\usepackage{cscolorthm}`.
4. Begin utilizing the provided commands and environments within your document to augment its clarity and expressiveness.
